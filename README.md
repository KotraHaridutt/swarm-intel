# Swarm-Intel: A Federated Learning Framework for Collaborative Satellite Constellations

## Project Description

Swarm-Intel is a novel solution designed to tackle the data ingestion bottleneck and high latency faced by next-generation satellite constellations. Traditional approaches rely on downlinking massive volumes of raw data to Earth for processing, a method that is slow, costly, and unsustainable.

Our project introduces a paradigm shift by leveraging **Federated Learning (FL)**. Instead of centralizing data, we centralize intelligence. The framework enables satellites to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model in orbit. Each satellite trains a local model on its private data and transmits only a small, compressed model update. These updates are aggregated by a "chief" satellite, and the improved global model is broadcast back to the entire constellation. This approach drastically reduces bandwidth usage, lowers latency, and enables near real-time, in-orbit intelligence.

## Key Features

* **Bandwidth Efficiency:** Achieves a 90-99% reduction in data transfer volume compared to traditional methods.
* **Near Real-Time Insights:** Eliminates the latency of downlinking raw data by performing intelligence extraction on-orbit.
* **Scalability & Robustness:** The decentralized architecture is designed to scale with a growing number of satellites and is robust to data heterogeneity.
* **Enhanced Privacy:** Raw, sensitive data remains on the satellites, improving data security.

## System Architecture

The system operates as an in-orbit client-server model.

* **Client Satellites:** Each satellite in the constellation acts as a client. It trains a lightweight machine learning model on its local, private data.
* **Chief Satellite:** A designated satellite acts as the central aggregator. It collects compressed model updates from all client satellites and applies a federated averaging algorithm to create a superior global model.
* **Communication:** Lightweight model updates are transmitted from clients to the chief, and the new global model is broadcast back to all clients.

This cycle of local training, communication, and aggregation allows the entire constellation to continuously improve its collective intelligence.
